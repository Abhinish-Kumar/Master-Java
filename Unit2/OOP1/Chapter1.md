### Abstraction :-
Hide internal detail and shoing only required feature.
eg:- buttons on tv , you not need to connect internal wire. 
You just have to use that feature without worring about the internal detail.

### Encapsulation :-
Hidden wires in a body , they are capsuled. 
A complete TV means a single box. all the things are in a single capsule.
Its not open in peaces its a single piece. Eg:- a phone is a single box. 
All the things are encapsulated in it. This is called as encapsulation or boxing.


###  Inheritance
